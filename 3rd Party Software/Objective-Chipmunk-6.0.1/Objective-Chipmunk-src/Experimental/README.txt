All of the code in here should be considered experimental. It's not ready to be added to the main development branch yet, but I expect that some power users of Chipmunk-Pro will find it useful anyway.

Because most of our yearly income is made working on contracts, I often have to put these projects aside while we pay the bills. By exposing these unfinished projects to our customers, we are hoping that you will be excited about their potential and bug us to finish them. ;)
