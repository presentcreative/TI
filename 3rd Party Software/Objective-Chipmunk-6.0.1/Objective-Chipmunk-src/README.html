	<h1>How to Get Started:</h1>
	
	<p>Installing Objective-Chipmunk is as simple as dropping the <code>Objective-Chipmunk-iPhone/</code> directory into your Xcode project. At that point you should simply be able use <code>#import "ObjectiveChipmunk.h"</code></p>
	
	<h1>Where to Go Next:</h1>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Skim the Chipmunk Physics documentation.
			( <a href="Chipmunk/doc/index.html">local</a> |
			<a href="http://files.slembcke.net/chipmunk/release/ChipmunkLatest-Docs/">online</a>)
			It's C API centric, but Chipmunk was programmed in an Object-Oriented style so the concepts apply directly to the Objective-C API.</li>
		<li>
			Read the Objective-C API Docs:
			(<a href="html/index.html">local</a> | 
			<a href="http://files.slembcke.net/chipmunk/release/Objective-ChipmunkLatest-Docs/">online</a>)
		</li>
		<li>
			Get sample code from the <a href="http://chipmunk-physics.net/downloads.php">Chipmunk downloads page</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If you need more example code, I've also included the source code for the Chipmunk Physics iPhone Demo App (iPhoneChipmunk) as well as Snap Physics (iPhoneSnap). </p>
	
	<h1>Building Objective-Chipmunk:</h1>
	
	<p>While Objective-Chipmunk comes prebuilt, we also believe you bought the right to the full source code for it by supporting us. That way if you want to make any modifications or need to debug something you can.</p>

	<p>The easiest way to build Objective-Chipmunk is to run the iphonestatic.command in the Objective-Chipmunk directory (double click in the Finder or run in the Terminal). This will build the iPhone static library will all the optimizations turned on, and build a simulator build with all the debug options turned on. It also builds a simulator only version.</p>
	
	<p>There is also an Xcode project provided. The iphonestatic.command script actually uses this same project file.</p>

	<p>Thank you for supporting Chipmunk's development and happy Chipmunking!</p>
